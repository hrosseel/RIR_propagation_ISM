# Visualizing RIR propagation between a source and receiver using Image Source Method

This repository contains a Python script that visualizes the propagation of the RIR between a source and receiver positioned in a 2D room. The animation is created using the Image Source Method (ISM) implemented in Pyroomacoustics.


## Examples
